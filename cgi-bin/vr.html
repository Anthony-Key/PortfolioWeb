                    <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                        Worlds was a multifunctional platform that provided users with n orientation and content page where they could download
                        courses/training modules that reward badges through API Integration. I got the opportunity to develop many systems on this platform such as Interactions and Movement
                        for the orientation and additionally on the content page, create the download and update system through android on the headset. I
                        also got to integrate a lot of the API into the front end, and in my own time created an app that hooked into the api to speed
                        up my and other colleagues work flow. Finally, I then worked on a orientation for the platform, where users will learn how to use the headset,
                        by interacting and moving around, as seen in the video to the side.

                    <p class="project-wrapper__text-info">
                        One of my projects during my time at Talkout was to create a learning module for a client. The first system I created was a universal quiz system where
                        you could see all the questions and answers in the inspector and change them as needed. I did this by using a variation of classes that made up the quiz.
                        It would then use a controller to read the serialized data from the inspector and show it in-game view. Any other developer who needed to change this had
                        access too: question, answer, time, audio, and because it was implemented using SOLID principles this is expandable by any other developer. Additionally I
                        created module 2, which was for diagnostic. They would be guided through a series of actions to ensure the bike was in good condition, showing clear instructions.

                        This project was to create fire training, that had each fire classification and

                        accurate systems with partical system collisions and be able to slowly put out the fire!
                        After the project was due, I got to demo infront of the CEO and seeing their reaction was fantastic!
                        They loved it.

                        loved! Check it out here: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Bunnky.DoggoParkour">Google Play</a>
