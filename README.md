## Getting Started

Onces cloned, open terminal, run command "yarn". This will install all the packages from package.json.

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

When the project is up and running, our "index" is called "page.tsx".

To change the colour scheme, hex's are found in the tailwind.config.js in the root of the directory.

Pushing automatically builds to prod, might be worth making branches and using pull requests.
